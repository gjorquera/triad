Description
===========

Triad is a 2D triangle mesh refinement application aimed at algorithm analysis
and research.

This means that the application is designed and implemented to be easy to extend
with new algorithms or visual properties.

Dependencies
============

Triad depends on the following libraries:
  - [Qt 4.4](http://www.qtsoftware.com/products)
  - Euclid
  - MeshViewer

Mesh Format
===========

The application uses the M2D file format, but other file formats can be
implemented extending the appropiate classes. For more information about the M2D
file format go to the [homepage](http://github.com/gjorquera/triangle-mesh)
